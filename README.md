### Hello there! Nice to meet you! üëã

## My name is Jakub and welcome to mu GitHub profile. Here you can find my projects from studies including my engineering thesis and also personal works. Some of repositories were upload after finishing whole project due to work on external infrastructure.

You can visit all my repositories - if you have question feel free to ask and reach me out. üì®

### Active repositories:
1. KMeans_PCA_Implementation [first version]
2. NN_Architectures [prototype - will be modified after Face Detection project]
3. Face_Detection_PyTorch [prototype - training first network - CNN (based on ResNet)]

### About me ‚¨áÔ∏è

I'm a BEng of Acoustic Engineering on AGH Krakow specializing in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I'm 23 years old and now I'm searching for oppurtunity for work or internship to explore world of AI. I do what I can to constantlly learn new thing and improve my work. I'm eager to gather new experiences and learn - because everyday there is possibility to discover something new.

In my free time I train to long-distance endurance runs, read books, hiking, spending time with friends, traveling and a lot more.

### Skills? üíª

If it comes to technologies and programming languages I mainly use **Python**, but I'm also familiar with:
- **C#**
- **C++**
- **SQL**
- **LabView**
- **MatLab**

I also had expieriences with **C**.

When it comes to frameworks and tools I'm familliar and ready-to-use with libs like:
- **Keras**
- **PyTorch**
- **Kaldi**
- **Pandas**
- **MatPlotLib**
- **ScikitLearn**
- **Numpy**
- **Tensorflow**
- **GitHub**
... and many more (but I think these are most important)

### Projects (ended recently or current) üì∂
1. Currently experimenting with some project with use of SQL
2. Learning on ML Algoritm and related topics (revisting)
3. Experimenting with implementing some ML Algoritm solutions from scratch
